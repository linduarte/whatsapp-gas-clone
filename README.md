# WhatsApp Gas Consumption Dashboard

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- uv package manager
- Chrome browser (for WhatsApp Web automation)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd whatsapp-gas-dashboard

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## 🔧 Running the Application

### Option 1: Run Both Services Together
```bash
# Start both FastAPI and Streamlit simultaneously
uv run start.py
```
This will automatically start:
- **FastAPI server** on `http://localhost:8000`
- **Streamlit frontend** on `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Run Services Separately (Recommended)

#### Terminal 1 - FastAPI Backend
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
- API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
- Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health check at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`

#### Terminal 2 - Streamlit Frontend
```bash
# Start the Streamlit web app
uv run streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```
- Web interface available at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Upload and Process Excel File
1. Open Streamlit app at `http://localhost:8501`
2. Navigate to **"📊 Upload Data"**
3. Select target **month** and **year** (e.g., February 2025)
4. Upload your Excel file with gas consumption data
5. Review the processed and filtered data

### Step 2: Preview and Validate
1. Go to **"👀 Preview Data"** tab
2. Verify apartment data, consumption values, and billing amounts
3. Check summary statistics (total apartments, consumption, value)

### Step 3: Send WhatsApp Message
1. Navigate to **"📱 Send WhatsApp"** tab
2. Review the formatted message preview
3. Enter the recipient's phone number (with country code)
4. Click **"📤 Send Message"**
5. Chrome browser will open WhatsApp Web automatically
6. Message will be sent to the billing office

## 🔍 API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend provides several endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/v1/upload-excel` - Upload and process Excel files
- `POST /api/v1/format-message` - Format gas consumption data
- `POST /api/v1/send-whatsapp` - Send WhatsApp messages
- `POST /api/v1/test-whatsapp-simple` - Test WhatsApp automation

  - `Data Leitura` (DD/MM/YYYY format)
  - `Apartamento`
  - `Leitura atual`
  - `Consumo(m³)`
  - `Cálculo`
  - `Valor final(R$)`

### WhatsApp Setup
- Ensure Chrome browser is installed
- WhatsApp Web will open automatically
- You'll need to scan QR code on first use
- Keep WhatsApp Web session active for automation

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**FastAPI not starting:**
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is available
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill existing process if needed
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
```

**Streamlit connection error:**
- Ensure FastAPI is running on port 8000
- Check firewall settings
- Verify API_BASE URL in streamlit_app.py

**WhatsApp automation issues:**
- Update Chrome browser to latest version
- Clear Chrome cache and cookies
- Restart Chrome completely
